# Web-Design-Challenge

The purpose of this homework was to create a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I've created for the Python-API homework, in which I plotted weather data.

The website consists of 7 pages:
1 LANDING PAGE:
 -  With an explanation of the project and links to each visualization pages.
4 VISUALIZATION PAGES:
-   Each contains [A descriptive title and heading tag, the plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison, A paragraph describing the plot and its significance]
1 COMPARISON PAGE:
-   With all of the visualizations on the same page.
1 DATA PAGE
-   With a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
