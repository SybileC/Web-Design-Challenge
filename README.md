# Web-Design-Challenge

The purpose of this homework was to create a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I've created for the Python-API homework, in which I plotted weather data.

The website consists of 7 pages:
•	A landing page containing:
    o	With an explanation of the project and links to each visualization pages.
•	Four visualization pages
    o	Each contains
        	A descriptive title and heading tag.
        	The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
        	A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
•	A "Comparisons" page:
    o	With all of the visualizations on the same page.
•	A "Data" page :
    o	With a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
